Your classes must compile meet the following requirements:

(10 points) Inheritance Relationship: Include at least one parent class and at least three child/grandchild classes that form an "is a" relationship. Classes can be concrete or abstract.
(55 points) Class Design: Each class must contain:
(10 points) instance data variables
(10 points) constructor(s)
(10 points) getters and setters
(10 points) overridden toString method
(15 points) overridden equals method 
	Note that classes can contain these requirements directly OR inherited from a parent.
(10 points) Methods: Your classes must have a total of at least three class-specific methods.
	You can have just simple printlns as the method implementation for now or you can have the methods do more.
	These methods must represent functionality of objects- some action or behavior that the object takes or that is taken on the object
	The getters/setters do not count!
	These methods must be instance methods- this means they cannot be static.
	You must have three methods total across all classes. You are not required to have three methods in each class.
(15 points) Driver: Write a driver program to demonstrate your classes:
	Create an array, List, or ArrayList using the parent class as the declared type.
	Fill with several different child objects.
	Invoke at least two methods on the objects. (If the method exists only in the child class, use instanceof and a downcast.)
(10 points) Style:
	follow Java coding conventions (Links to an external site.)
	follow general best practices and principles of object-oriented class design, encapsulation, and inheritance
	properly format and indent code
	follow naming conventions for variables, classes, and methods
	reduce duplicated code
